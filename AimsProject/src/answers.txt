- What class should implement the Comparable interface?
the Media class should implement the Comparable interface because it is the parent class for all media types (Disc, DigitalVideoDisc, CompactDisc, Book) 
and contains the common fields (id, title, category, cost) used for comparison.

- How should you implement the compareTo() method to reflect the ordering that we want?
we compare the title fields in alphabetical order (case-insensitive).
if the title fields are the same, compare the cost fields in descending order.

- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
no, the Comparable interface allows only one natural ordering of objects, as defined by the compareTo() method. 
to have multiple ordering rules, the Comparator interface is used. 
the Comparator interface allows defining custom comparison logic different from the natural ordering of the objects.

- Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
to make a different ordering rule for DVDs, we can override the compareTo() method specifically in the DigitalVideoDisc class to follow the ordering rule: by title, then by decreasing length, then by cost.
